                    <p class="long-review">"Michelle and her staff go above and beyond in providing an overall great experience. The place is neat, clean, organized and has a nice feel. Employees are friendly. Wait time is much shorter than at the major chain pharmacies and prices are better too. Most importantly the time spent going over questions and concerns is the best I have ever seen from any pharmacy. They really take the time and effort to make sure you are made to feel important, not rushed and satisfied each and every time. A throwback to the old fashioned neighborhood pharmacies from way back in the day."</p>
